# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to http://adventofcode.com

All solutions are written in Haskell.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/petertseng/adventofcode-hs-2015.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/petertseng/adventofcode-hs-2015)

## Input

In general, all solutions can be invoked in both of the following ways:

* Without command-line arguments, takes input on standard input.
* With 1+ command-line arguments, reads input from the first, which must be the path to an input file.
  Arguments beyond the first are ignored.

Some may additionally support other ways:

* 4 (Advent Coins): Pass the secret key in ARGV.
* 10 (Look and Say): Pass the seed sequence in ARGV.
* 11 (Passwords): Pass the initial password in ARGV.
* 20 (Factors): Pass the target number of gifts in ARGV.
